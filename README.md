![two added sine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62f2cb01-f2ac-42aa-9c7e-8777224cc553)

This repository includes an implementation that generates a signal by adding two sine waves together. 
The resulting signal is the sum of two sine functions, each potentially with different frequencies, amplitudes, and phases.
